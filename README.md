This project aims to built a book recommendation engine with machine learning. This project has been mainly inspired by another project in this article https://randerson112358.medium.com/build-a-book-recommendation-system-using-python-machine-learning-ca6259d70319

The dataset has been taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019?resource=download.



# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->
